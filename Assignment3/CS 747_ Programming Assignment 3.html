<h2>
CS 747: Programming Assignment 3
</h2>
</center>

<p> As a part of this assignment, you will implement the <i>Windy
Gridworld</i> task given as Example 6.5 by Sutton and Barto
(2018). You will program some agent-environment interactions, record
  your results, and present your interpretations.</p>

<p> Unlike the previous assignments, there is no autograder script for
this assignment. You can design your own code structure, internal
data formats, etc. But your code still needs to be able to run on the
docker; you must describe its usage in a README file.</p>


<br>
<h3>Tasks</h3> 

<ol>
<li>Implement Windy Gridworld as an episodic MDP. The core of your
code will have to be a function (or functions) to obtain next state
and reward for a given state and action. You can use your own function
names and conventions.</li>

<li>Implement a Sarsa(0) agent as described in the example, and obtain
a baseline plot similar to the one accompanying the example (episodes
against time steps). You can set learning and exploration rates as you
see fit (just be sure to describe them in your report).</li>

<li>Get another plot when King's moves are permitted (that is, 8
actions in total), as described in Exercise 6.9.</li>

<li>Add stochasticity to the task as described in Exercise 6.10, and
again plot the resulting performance of the Sarsa(0) agent. Make sure you
note down your convention for modeling corner cases.</li>

<li>Implement 2 with Expected Sarsa and Q-learning agents in place of
the Sarsa agent, again with full bootstrapping. Create a combined plot
comparing Sarsa, Expected Sarsa, and Q-learning. Use the same learning
and exploration rates for all three methods. You only need to create
the baseline plot as a part of this task (no King's moves, no
stochasticity).</li>

</ol>

<p>In all your experiments, generate at least ten independent runs by
varying the random seed. Plot the average statistic in the graphs.</p><p>

<br>
    
</p><h3>Submission</h3> 

Create a directory called <code>submission</code> and place the
following material in it.

<ol>
  <li> Your code for implementing the task and its variants;</li>
  <li> Code for your Sarsa, Expected Sarsa, and Q-learning agents;</li>
  <li> A script to run your simulations and gather data;</li>
  <li> Plots of your agent's performance;</li>
  <li> A README file describing how to run your code and obtain the plots; and</li>
  <li> A report presenting your observations from these experiments
  (as a pdf file named <code>report.pdf</code>). Place the plots in
  the report and provide accompanying commentary, rather than keeping
  the plots and text separate.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>

<p>Compress the directory into <code>submission.tar.gz</code> and upload
on Moodle under Programming Assignment 3.</p>

<p>Convince yourself that the results obtained match your
expectations. Feel free to be creative and use the simulation
environment to test related hypotheses you might find
interesting. Your observations (under 6) must explain the variations
observed across the three task settings, and report any particular
issues you encountered while experimenting with this task. Don't
hesitate to include additional numbers or graphs.</p>

<br>
<h3>Evaluation</h3> 

<p>Your marks will be divided roughly equally among the four tasks you
  have to implement after setting up the agent and environment. For
  each task the marks will be determined by the plot and the
  accompanying observations.</p>

<p>The TAs and instructor may look at your source code and notes to
corroborate the results obtained by your program, and may also call
you to a face-to-face session to explain your code.</p>


<br>
<h3>Deadline and Rules</h3> 


<p>Your submission is due by 11.55 p.m., Friday, November 13. Finish
  working on your submission well in advance, keeping enough time to
  validate your code and to upload your submission to Moodle.</p>

<p>Your submission will not be evaluated (and will be given a score of
  zero) if it is not uploaded to Moodle by the deadline. Do not send
  your code or report to the instructor or TAs through any other
  channel. Requests to evaluate late submissions will not be
  entertained.</p>

<p>Your submission will receive a score of zero if your code does not
execute on the cs747 docker container. To make sure you have uploaded the right
version, download it and check after submitting (but before the
deadline, so you can handle any contingencies before the deadline
  lapses).</p>

<p>You are expected to comply with the rules laid out in the "Academic
Honesty" section on the course web page, failing which you are liable
to be reported for academic malpractice.</p>
